  - Abstract: Knowledge of the causal structure that underlies a data
    generating process is essential to answering questions of causal
    nature. Such questions are abundant in fields that involve
    decision making such as econometrics, epidemiology, and social
    sciences. When causal knowledge is unavailable, one can resort to
    causal discovery algorithms, which attempt to recover causal
    relationships from data. This talk will present a new algorithm
    for this task, that combines continuous-constrained optimization
    with the flexible density estimation capabilities of normalizing
    flows. In contrast with previous work in this direction, our
    method combines observational and interventional data to improve
    identification of the causal graph. We will present empirical
    results, along with a theoretical justification of our algorithm.
  - Short bio: Alexandre Drouin is a Research Scientist at Element AI
    in Montréal, Canada and an Adjunct Professor of computer science
    at Laval University. He received a PhD in machine learning from
    Laval University in 2019 for his work on antibiotic resistance
    prediction in bacterial genomes. His research interests include
    causal inference, deep learning, and bioinformatics
