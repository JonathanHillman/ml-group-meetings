- Feb 8: [[https://dvvenuto.github.io/][David Venuto]], Thinking Realistically with Deep Reinforcement
  Learning.
  - Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) gives us a framework for
    learning how to take intelligent actions in an environment
    represented as a Markov Decision Process. Recent advances have
    been able to learn in highly complex environments by learning
    policies and value functions approximated with deep neural
    networks.  These advances come with a wide set of challenges
    including learning generalizable policies and designing good
    reward functions.  We will first give a brief introduction to the
    paradigm of RL and how we have leveraged deep learning to improve
    policy optimization.  Next, we will discuss common issues in deep
    RL and how we can learn with more robustness by leveraging expert
    data and learning modular and hierarchical policies.

  Interventional Data]]. 
  - Abstract: Knowledge of the causal structure that underlies a data
    generating process is essential to answering questions of causal
    nature. Such questions are abundant in fields that involve
    decision making such as econometrics, epidemiology, and social
    sciences. When causal knowledge is unavailable, one can resort to
    causal discovery algorithms, which attempt to recover causal
    relationships from data. This talk will present a new algorithm
    for this task, that combines continuous-constrained optimization
    with the flexible density estimation capabilities of normalizing
    flows. In contrast with previous work in this direction, our
    method combines observational and interventional data to improve
    identification of the causal graph. We will present empirical
    results, along with a theoretical justification of our algorithm.

    in Montr√©al, Canada and an Adjunct Professor of computer science
    at Laval University. He received a PhD in machine learning from
    Laval University in 2019 for his work on antibiotic resistance
    prediction in bacterial genomes. His research interests include
    causal inference, deep learning, and bioinformatics
