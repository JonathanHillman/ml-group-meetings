How to write and organize a research paper including reproducible code
for making figures

** Basic organization

The unit of Computer Science discovery is the research paper, which
describes a new idea to share with the research community. Every paper
should contain at least five main sections

- Background: what is the problem setting and data? e.g., for
  regression the data is a n x p input/feature matrix, an n-vector of
  outputs/labels, problem is learning a function which takes a
  p-dimensional input/feature vector and returns a real-valued
  output/prediction.
- Previous work: what are the existing approaches for that problem,
  and what are their drawbacks that motivate a new algorithm? e.g.,
  for regression there are linear models, neural networks, boosting,
  etc.
- Novelty: what are the new ideas presented in the paper? Are they
  theoretical or empirical, or both? e.g., the paper could use
  existing models/data and present a new proof about the
  optimality/speed of an existing algorithm, or it could use existing
  algorithms/data with a new neural network model architecture, or it
  could present new benchmark data sets for comparing various existing
  algorithms/models.
- Results: what comparisons were done to show that the new idea is
  interesting/useful in theory and/or in practice? e.g., you could
  compare the test accuracy and computation time for different
  regression algorithms on various data sets.
- Future work: what are some of your ideas for new research papers
  that could be written as a follow up to this one? Justify why these
  ideas are sufficiently novel that they warrant a new paper
  describing them.

** Related work table

Typically for the background/novelty/results sections it is useful to
make figures that help prove the points you are trying to make. For
the previous work section it is often useful to have a table that
compares your new idea with previous work, e.g., for the paper I'm
working on with Alyssa,

| Method   | Publication                  | time       | labels | up-down | prediction |

** Reproducible code for figures

For the figures I create a github repository for each paper.
- figure-something-data.R creates a CSV data file needed to create the figure.
- figure-something.R reads CSV file, creates the PNG figure file.
- Makefile organizes the computation, typically top recipe is
  slides.pdf which depends on all figures (useful for reproducibility).
- README.org with links to each code/figure file (useful visual index).
- Use LaTeX / overleaf, with "External URL" figures which are easy to
  update after pushing to github.
Input Data files? (e.g., large data bases to analyzes)
- dont put it in the github repo (if too big).
- instead have a R script that downloads the data files.
When you want to add a figure file
- add an entry in Makefile (reproducibility)
- add an entry in README.org (visual index)
- add to git repo, commit, push to github (backup)
- add to overleaf with External URL
When you want to update a figure file
- commit and push to github
- go to overleaf file and click "update"
